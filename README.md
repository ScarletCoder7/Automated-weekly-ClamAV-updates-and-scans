# Automated-weekly-ClamAV-updates-and-scans-on-Linux
Implemented automated ClamAV antivirus updates and scans with a weekly cron job on a Linux distribution, enhancing system security. Utilized a shell script to stop, update, and start ClamAV, followed by a recursive scan of the Downloads directory every Thursday at 13:53.
